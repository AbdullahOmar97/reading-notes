Relational Databases:

Structure: Relational databases organize data into tables, where each table consists of rows and columns. Tables are related to each other through keys, typically primary and foreign keys.
Data Integrity: Relational databases enforce data integrity through constraints such as primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, unique constraints, and check constraints.
Normalization: Normalization is the process of organizing data to minimize redundancy and dependency. It involves breaking down large tables into smaller ones and establishing relationships between them to reduce data duplication.
ACID Properties: Relational databases ensure data integrity and consistency through ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. Transactions in relational databases follow these properties to maintain data integrity.
SQL (Structured Query Language):

Querying: SQL is used to query relational databases to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data. Common SQL commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN.
Data Manipulation: SQL allows for the manipulation of data within tables using commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. These commands enable adding new records, updating existing records, and deleting records from tables.
Data Retrieval: The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables based on specified criteria. It can filter data using WHERE clause, sort data using ORDER BY clause, and group data using GROUP BY clause.
Data Definition: SQL is also used for defining and modifying database structures such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints. Commands like CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and DROP TABLE are used for these purposes.
Data Control: SQL provides commands for managing user access to the database objects. GRANT and REVOKE statements are used to grant and revoke privileges on database objects to users and roles.
