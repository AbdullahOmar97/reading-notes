***Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice***

The topic discussed is the concept of deliberate practice in improving technical skills, particularly in software development. Deliberate practice involves engaging in activities specifically designed to push oneself just beyond their comfort zone, repeated often, and with feedback readily available. It emphasizes mental challenge, difficulty, and setting good goals to facilitate learning and skill improvement.

The key points highlighted include:

1. **Purposeful Practice**: Unlike routine tasks or "playing" through work, deliberate practice involves intentionally working on challenging tasks that stretch one's abilities.

2. **Feedback Loop**: Feedback is essential for improvement. In software development, code correctness provides immediate feedback, but other aspects like code readability or security might require more subjective evaluation.

3. **Repetition and Challenge**: Improvement comes through repetition and confronting challenging problems regularly. This helps reinforce learning and enables the application of new skills in diverse contexts.

4. **Setting Goals**: Goals should be set to facilitate learning and growth, focusing on acquiring new skills rather than just completing tasks.

5. **Examples**: The Matasano Crypto Challenges and Rosalind are cited as examples of deliberate practice resources in software development, challenging developers with complex problems and providing continuous feedback.

The importance of stepping out of one's comfort zone, seeking novel challenges, and embracing the discomfort of learning is emphasized throughout the discussion. Ultimately, deliberate practice fosters continuous improvement and mastery in technical fields like software development.



**Understanding the concept of deliberate practice is highly relevant to a Python course for several reasons:**

1. **Skill Development**: Python courses aim to help learners develop proficiency in programming with Python. Deliberate practice offers a structured approach to improving technical skills, which can greatly enhance the effectiveness of a Python course.

2. **Effective Learning Strategies**: Deliberate practice provides learners with effective learning strategies to complement the content covered in a Python course. It encourages learners to actively engage with the material, seek out challenging problems, and continuously refine their skills.

3. **Mastery in Python**: Mastery in Python programming requires more than just completing exercises or assignments. Deliberate practice emphasizes the importance of pushing oneself beyond the comfort zone, seeking feedback, and setting specific goalsâ€”all of which are crucial for mastering Python.

4. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Python courses often focus on problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. Deliberate practice helps learners develop these skills by encouraging them to tackle challenging problems and refine their problem-solving strategies over time.

5. **Adaptability and Growth Mindset**: Python is a versatile language used in various domains, from web development to data science. Deliberate practice fosters a growth mindset and adaptability by encouraging learners to explore new concepts, technologies, and applications beyond the scope of the course.

Incorporating the principles of deliberate practice into a Python course can significantly enhance the learning experience and empower learners to become proficient and confident Python programmers.


**Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset**

The video is about the power of yet. Carol Dweck, a psychologist, talks about the growth mindset and how it can help students succeed.

Dweck explains the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset. People with a fixed mindset believe that their intelligence is fixed and they can't change it. People with a growth mindset believe that their intelligence can grow with effort.

Dweck conducted a study where she gave 10-year-olds some difficult problems. Some of the children had a growth mindset and said things like "I love a challenge" or "I was hoping this would be informative." These children understood that their abilities could grow through hard work. Other children had a fixed mindset and said things like "This is awful" or "I'm no good at this." These children believed that their intelligence had been tested and they had failed.

Dweck says that the brain can be measured as kids encounter errors. When a child with a growth mindset encounters an error, their brain is active and processing the error. This means that they are learning from the error. When a child with a fixed mindset encounters an error, their brain is not active. This means that they are not learning from the error.

Dweck says that we can help children develop a growth mindset by praising their effort and perseverance. We can also teach them that their brains can grow with effort.

Dweck gives examples of how teachers have used a growth mindset to help their students succeed. One teacher took her kindergarten class in Harlem to the 95th percentile on the national achievement test. Another teacher took her fourth-grade class in the South Bronx to the top of New York state on the state math test.

Dweck concludes the video by saying that the more we know that basic human abilities can be grown, the more it becomes a basic human right for kids and adults to live in environments that create growth.


**The power of passion and perseverance**

According to the video, Angela Duckworth, a psychologist, gave a TED talk on the importance of grit. Grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals. Duckworth came to the conclusion that grit is more important than IQ in predicting success.  She studied cadets at West Point, children at the National Spelling Bee, rookie teachers, and salespeople to find out what characteristics made people successful. Grit was the most important factor.

Duckworth then studied grit in the Chicago public schools. She found that grittier students were more likely to graduate even when they were matched on other factors like family income and standardized test scores.

Duckworth says that we don't know very much about how to build grit. Talent is not the same as grit. She says that growth mindset, which is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, is a good idea for building grit.  She believes that more research is needed to find out how to teach grit.

**The power of believing that you can improve**

According to the video, Carol S. Dweck, a psychologist, argues that having a growth mindset is important for success.

A growth mindset is the belief that your abilities can be developed through effort. Dweck contrasts this with a fixed mindset, which is the belief that your abilities are fixed.

Dweck discusses a study where students were given problems that were slightly too hard for them. Students with a growth mindset embraced the challenge, while students with a fixed mindset became discouraged.

Dweck argues that we should praise children for their effort and strategies, rather than their intelligence or talent. This will help them develop a growth mindset.

Dweck also discusses a new online math game that rewards students for effort and strategy, rather than just getting the answer right. Students who played the game showed more perseverance when they hit difficult problems.

Finally, Dweck discusses the importance of growth mindset for equality. She argues that when students believe their abilities can grow, they are more likely to succeed. She cites examples of schools that have successfully used growth mindset to improve the achievement of all students.
