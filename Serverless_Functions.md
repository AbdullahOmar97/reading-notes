# Serverless Functions: Your Website's New Best Friend

## Summary
Managing a traditional server for your website can be time-consuming and costly as your site grows. Serverless functions offer a solution where you can focus on writing code while cloud providers handle the infrastructure. This approach can save money since you only pay for the resources you use and improves efficiency by automatically scaling capacity.

## Benefits of Serverless Functions
- Simplifies code deployment and maintenance.
- Reduces downtime and enhances application performance.
- Cost-effective with a pay-as-you-go model.
- Allows developers to focus on creating new features instead of managing servers.

## When to Use Serverless
- To reduce server costs.
- To free up developer resources.
- To easily scale web applications.



# Full Stack Python - Serverless

## Serverless Overview
Serverless is a deployment architecture where developers don't explicitly manage servers. Instead, code is executed based on defined events, like an HTTP POST request or a file update.

### How Does Serverless Work?
Servers are still involved but are abstracted away and managed by platforms like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. Developers focus on writing code without handling server management.

### Serverless Compute Spectrum
- **Full Control**: Building your own server from components.
- **Serverless**: Platforms handle all hardware and software, running code without developer interaction with the infrastructure.



# What is Serverless Computing?

Serverless computing is an application development and execution model that allows developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.

## Key Concepts
- **Server Management**: In serverless computing, servers are managed by a cloud service provider (CSP) and are invisible to the developer.
- **Developer Focus**: Developers can concentrate on writing front-end application code and business logic.
- **Cloud Provider Role**: The cloud provider handles infrastructure provisioning, scaling, and maintenance, including OS updates, security, capacity planning, and system monitoring.
- **Billing**: Billing is based on execution time and resources used. Developers only pay for active code execution, eliminating costs for idle capacity.

## Evolution and Adoption
Serverless computing emerged with Google App Engine (GAE) in 2008 and gained significant traction with AWS Lambda in 2014. Today, major CSPs offer serverless platforms, including AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and IBM Cloud Code Engine.

## Serverless Ecosystem
### Serverless and Function as a Service (FaaS)
- **FaaS**: Central to serverless computing, allowing code execution in response to events without infrastructure management.
- **Serverless Stack**: Includes databases, storage, API gateways, and event-driven architecture.

### Serverless Databases and Storage
- **Serverless Databases**: Scale with demand without provisioning instances.
- **Serverless Storage**: Object storage that scales with demand.

### API Gateways
- **Role**: Act as proxies for web application actions, providing HTTP method routing, client ID and secrets, rate limits, CORS, API usage logs, and sharing policies.

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Integration**: Serverless functions handle events in an event-driven architecture, essential for real-time processing and automation.

## Comparison with Other Models
- **Provisioning Time**: Instantaneous (milliseconds) for serverless.
- **Administrative Burden**: None for serverless, varies for PaaS, containers, and VMs.
- **Maintenance**: Managed entirely by CSPs for serverless.
- **Scaling**: Instant autoscaling, including scaling to zero.
- **Resource Utilization**: 100% efficient, no idle capacity costs.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
### Pros
- **Improved Productivity**: Focus on code, not infrastructure.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for execution time.
- **Language Flexibility**: Support for multiple programming languages.
- **Simplified DevOps**: Easier integration, testing, and deployment.
- **Reduced Latency**: Code runs closer to the end-user.
- **Usage Visibility**: Comprehensive system and user activity tracking.

### Cons
- **Less Control**: Dependence on CSPs for server management.
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Unique features and capabilities tied to specific providers.
- **Cold Starts**: Potential latency during initial function execution.
- **Complex Debugging**: Limited visibility into backend processes.
- **Higher Costs for Long-Running Processes**: Not optimized for prolonged execution.

## Security
Serverless security follows a shared responsibility model, with CSPs handling infrastructure security and developers responsible for application code security. Adopting DevSecOps practices is recommended to ensure secure serverless deployments.

## Sustainability
Serverless computing optimizes resource efficiency and reduces idle capacity, contributing to lower energy consumption and a reduced carbon footprint.

## Use Cases
- **Microservices**: Supporting small, independent services with automatic scaling.
- **API Backends**: Creating web actions and APIs with security and scalability features.
- **Data Processing**: Handling structured text, audio, image, and video data.
- **Parallel Computing**: Suitable for tasks like data processing, MapReduce operations, and simulations.
- **Stream Processing**: Integrating with event-driven platforms like Apache Kafka for real-time data processing.


Serverless computing, microservices, and containers are central to cloud-native application development, offering scalability, efficiency, and flexibility for modern workloads.



# What Is Vercel? Is It The Right Platform For Front-End Developers?

## What Is Vercel? üî∫

Vercel (formerly known as ZEIT) is a cloud platform that enables developers to host websites and web services that deploy instantly, scale automatically, and require no supervision. Founded in 2015 by Guillermo Rauch, the platform offers an intuitive user interface with minimal configuration for hosting static site generators such as Gatsby or Hugo and various CMSes like Contentful, Prismic, or WordPress. Vercel is also the parent company of the Next.js framework and comes with many cool features.

Frankly speaking, Vercel is the most accessible platform to deploy websites. By connecting the GitHub repository to it, you can simply deploy the main branch to the platform‚Äôs domains ‚Äî and it does all the heavy lifting by:
- Deploying your site to a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) instantly with a single click.
- Ensuring your site is always online by intelligently monitoring and automatically scaling frontend capacity, and
- Taking care of SSL certificates or HTTPS on your behalf.

## 3 Outstanding Features

1. **Custom Domain and SSL**: Vercel allows developers to set up their projects with a custom domain (or a free URL) and a free automatic SSL, protecting shared encrypted data between the server and the browser.
2. **Integration with Git**: It integrates directly with GitHub or GitLab, allowing developers to host static websites and web applications that deploy upon every push in branches or pull requests to preview changes.
3. **Automatic Scaling**: It scales automatically, requiring no orchestration, and operates and monitors with no server configuration.

## Benefits of Vercel ‚≠ê

- **Ease of Deployment**: It‚Äôs super simple to deploy websites or applications on Vercel. There is no need to handle issues such as server unavailability since hosting your business site on the platform means deploying it instantly. 
- **Automatic Scaling**: It‚Äôs configured with automatic scaling in mind, so no matter how popular your website becomes, there will always be enough computing power to support it.

## How Does Vercel Work? ‚öôÔ∏è

To deploy applications on Vercel, you should create a project that groups deployments and custom domains together. Each project will receive deployment requests from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Vercel CLI.

You can easily create a project from the Vercel dashboard or import it from an existing Git repository. You can custom name the project, edit build and development settings, modify the root directory, and configure other variables. Besides, you can also add custom domains to each project. In addition, the platform supports deploy hooks, which are unique URLs that accept HTTP POST requests and trigger deployments.

The platform comes with password and SSO protection to add to the security of the deployment process, ensuring that the visitors of preview deployment must log in with a personal Vercel account. Projects can be transferred between Vercel Accounts with zero downtime and no workflow interruptions. This is particularly useful when upgrading from a personal account to a pro team.
