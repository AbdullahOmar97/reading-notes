Essentially, it translates data between these two paradigms, simplifying how developers interact with databases through OOP methods like create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations.

# ORM tools are software designed to streamline database interactions in OOP languages. Instead of manually coding SQL queries, developers use ORM methods that abstract these operations. For instance, retrieving user data with SQL might look like SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id = 20, whereas an ORM might simplify this to users.getById(20).

# In Django, a model serves as the primary source of information about data. It defines the structure and behavior of the data storing in your application. Here are the key points about Django models:

# Definition: Each Django model is a Python class that inherits from django.db.models.Model. This inheritance signifies that the class is a Django model and should be stored in the database.

# Fields: Attributes of the model class represent fields in the corresponding database table. These fields define the structure of the data stored in the database.

# Mapping: Typically, each Django model maps to a single database table. The fields of the model correspond to columns in the table, and instances of the model represent rows.

# API Generation: Django automatically generates an API for database access based on your model definitions. This API allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your database without writing SQL queries directly.

# Querying: Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system translates Python code into SQL queries, providing a high-level abstraction for database interactions. This simplifies database access and makes it more Pythonic.

# By using Django models, developers can define their application's data structure in a Pythonic way and leverage Django's powerful ORM to interact with the database efficiently.
